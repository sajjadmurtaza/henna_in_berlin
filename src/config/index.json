    "description": "Henna has long been used for beautification and increasing the appeal and worth of the body. As one of the most popular and safest forms of body arts today, applying henna is becoming increasingly popular not only in the Eastern countries but also the Western ones as well. Everyone now sees the beauty in the delicate and intricate lines with the impressive reddish-brown hue. Henna (also known as mehndi) is a tropical or shrub called Lawsonia Inermis which has natural dyeing and conditioning properties. The paste made from the dried and powdered leaves of the Henna plant is used in creating intricate ethnic or contemporary designs on various parts of the body. Though traditionally applied to the hands and feet of women, where it long played a significant part in the wedding rituals across cultures, Henna is now becoming a fashion statement in the western culture, as a contemporary tattoo. As a reputable brand with rich experience in using the henna dye to create impeccable and unique designs for various applications, we understand the need to work with only 100% natural and safe henna."
